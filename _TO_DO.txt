### MY PERSONAL TEACHING MAP, CLASS PLAN TEMPLATE –> SVG DOWNLOAD BUTTONS
	SVGS ARE IN ICONS —> DOWNLOAD ICONS, AND THE PLACES WHERE THEY NEED TO BE POSITIONED ARE UNDERLINED IN THE ARTICLES (ITS 4 ALTOGETHER).

### IMAGES QUALITY 

### WORK TO BE DISCOVERED 
	WE USED TEMPLATE 5 (2 COLUMNS OF TEXT AND ANCHORED VIDEO) AND IT DOESN’T WORK. 
	THE PLAY BUTTON IS POSITIONED OFF, AND THE VIDEO FRAME DOESN’T STAY. 
	IT SHOULD ALIGN TO THE TOP OF THE PARAGRAPH ON THE LEFT AND WHEN SCROLLING STICK TO THE TOP (36PX BELOW MENU) AND SCROLL UP WHEN TEMPLATE 5 ENDS. 
	IF ITS TOO COMPLICATED WE CAN THINK OF LETTING IT GO AND SOLVING IT ANOTHER WAY SO LET US KNOW. 

### NOTES NEED TO SWIPE IN FROM BOTTOM WHEN CLICKED (AS IN THE INDD FILE)

### LIGHTBOX – MAKE AS JQUERY PLUGIN

### IMAGES BOX-SHADOW DIFFERENT SCREENS (RETINA LOOKS SMALL)

### FOOTNOTE NUMBERS JUMP UP IN THE LIST ON HTTP://MINDTHEDANCE.COM/TEST/#ARTICLE/46/HUNTING-GATHERING-CULTIVATING

### SPLIT SCREEN + 
	PARALLEL MODE FOR SATELLITES 

### ADD OPTION TO ADD IMAGE COVERS FOR VIDEOS (NOT THROUGH VIMEO) TO COVER THE PLAYER BAR.

### MANUAL FOR VIDEO DOCUMENTATION OF A DANCE CLASS
	ON THE FIRST LIST ON THE TOP, INDENTATION IN LARGE TEXT LIST TWO SHOULD ALIGN TO LIST ONE (BULLET BELOW LIST CONTENT). IN HUNTING, GATHERING, CULTIVATING: PRACTICAL SCORES, IT DOES ALIGN FOR SOME REASON...
	THE BULLETS IN THE TOP LIST SHOULD BE THE SAME SIZE AS IN THE A,B,C CATEGORIES FOLLOWING. 
	IMAGES ON THE RIGHT COLUMN SHOULD ALIGN TO PARAGRAPH THEY’RE ATTACHED TO. (ADD “ASSIGN TO” CLASS)
	IN THE LIST ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE THE STIX SYMBOLS IN LIST 2 DON’T ALIGN TO THE TEXT (TOO HIGH)

### IF ARTICLE STARTS WITH AN IMAGE THE IMAGE MARGIN-TOP SHOULD BE TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION WITH TITLE-WRAPPER MARGIN-BOTTOM (SEE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ON SCORES AND MOVING WRITING DRAWING IN WHERE THE ARTICLE STARTS)

### ADD INDICATOR (+1, +2, ETC) NEXT TO BOOK EDITOR ICON AFTER ADDING ARTICLES

### JUMPING TO AN ANCHOR POINT SHOULD SCROLL DOWN AND NOT JUMP, AND THE ANCHOR POINT SHOULD ANCHOR TO BELOW THE MENU BAR. SEE “MANUAL FOR VIDEO DOCUMENTATION OF A DANCE CLASS”
